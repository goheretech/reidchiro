<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    The New York Times reports that the average person in their mid- to late 60s
    today is taking 15 prescription drugs a year — and that doesn’t even count
    the number of over-the-counter products they may be taking.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    That’s a lot of medications, especially when you consider that a survey
    released by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) not quite
    four years ago, in 2016, indicated that 75% of the respondents — all over
    age 50 — said they take at least one prescription medication on a regular
    basis.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    In that AARP survey, more than 80% reported taking at least two, and more
    than 50% took four or more. Compared to a 2005 Gallup survey, which showed
    52% of all Americans said they were taking at least one prescription
    medication, it’s obvious that seniors are taking more drugs than they did in
    the past.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Specifically, from 1988 to 2010, adults over age 65 doubled the number of
    prescriptions they took from two to four. The proportion of adults taking
    five or more tripled in that same time period. Yet, despite the rising
    number of prescriptions, more drugs don’t add up to better health.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    According to the researchers, “Contemporary older adults on multiple
    medications have worse health status compared to those on fewer medications,
    and appear to be a vulnerable population.” This translates to a negative
    effect on activities of everyday living as well as increased confusion and
    memory problems.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    The term used to describe a condition in which a person takes multiple
    medications, drugs, supplements and over-the-counter remedies is
    polypharmacy. As evidenced by the quoted research, the clinical relevance
    and consequences of polypharmacy — of seniors taking fistfuls of medications
    each day — are far-reaching as the aging population across the world
    continues to grow.
</p>

    Polypharmacy Raises Safety Risk
</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Polypharmacy is common among the elderly, especially for those who reside in
    nursing homes. Some end up in a nursing home because of adverse drug
    reactions, which places financial and emotional burdens on communities and
    families. They also may result in a significant number of hospitalizations
    with a high number of complications, increased rates of death and excessive
    health care costs.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    What’s worse, you may believe the federal government, medical associations
    or pharmaceutical companies have tested the effects that combinations of
    drug chemicals would have in your body but, unfortunately, this doesn’t
    always happen.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Researchers report these adverse drug reactions are responsible for up to
    12% of all hospital admissions of seniors. Yet, even being in the hospital
    doesn’t ensure against, or reduce, polypharmacy.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    In one study, a team in Italy evaluated 1,332 inpatients who were at least
    65 years old and who took at least five medications. They found polypharmacy
    was present in 51.9% of the patients when they arrived at the hospital; this
    increased to 67% by the time they left.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:8px;">
    Taking One Drug to Offset Side Effects of Another Drug
</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    One of the hidden dangers of polypharmacy is the chemical interactions that
    occur in the body when medications are mixed. Another problem is the number
    of times one drug is prescribed to take care of the side effects of another.
    This has become known as a “prescribing cascade.” The New York Times writes:
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    “One common example is the use of anti-Parkinson therapy for symptoms caused
    by antipsychotic drugs, with the anti-Parkinson drugs in turn causing new
    symptoms like a precipitous drop in blood pressure or delirium that result
    in yet another prescription.”
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    To that end, drug interactions can cause hospitalizations in and of
    themselves — and sometimes these interactions can even lead to death. The
    authors of one study noted a 50% increase in this problem when seniors are
    taking five to nine medications.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Dr. Michael Stern, geriatric emergency medicine specialist at New York
    Presbyterian Hospital, told a New York Times reporter that polypharmacy
    accounts for more than one-fourth of all admissions to the hospital and that
    it would be considered the fifth leading cause of death if it were
    categorized that way.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:8px;">
    Antidepressant Use Has Doubled in Seniors
</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    In a study published in 2013, scientists looked at participants who were
    prescribed antidepressants by their physicians. Of those who were over age
    65, only 14.3% met the DSM-4 criteria for having had a major depressive
    episode — indicating they most likely were overprescribed or not necessary.
    The authors noted the importance of providing better diagnoses to patients
    as well as more appropriate treatments of their symptoms.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    And again, statistics show more prescriptions don’t translate into fewer
    depressive illnesses. For example, in a 2017 study, researchers reviewed
    data from 1990 to 2015 that had been gathered in England, Canada, the U.S.
    and Australia and found the incidence of symptoms had not decreased despite
    an increase in the number of prescriptions of antidepressants.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    This is important because the risks associated with depression in seniors
    include cognitive decline, dementia and poor medical outcomes. Those
    suffering from depression in any age group also experience higher rates of
    suicide and mortality.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    This is one reason the American Psychiatric Association writes that in some
    cases, treatment for the elderly “should parallel that used in younger age
    groups.” Unfortunately, even though therapy for depression can include
    psychotherapy and alternative treatments, such as addressing vitamin
    deficiencies, good sleep habits, proper nutrition and exercise, too often,
    seniors are only prescribed medication — and that only adds to the multiple
    prescriptions they’re probably already taking.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:8px;">
    Studies Link Depression to Inflammation
</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    In related studies, researchers have found that inflammation contributes to
    many chronic diseases including heart disease and dementia. They also have
    found a link between inflammation and depression. The authors of one
    literature review included results from 30 randomized control trials with a
    total of 1,610 participants. Data analysis showed anti-inflammatory agents
    could reduce depressive disorder when compared to a placebo.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Results from another large meta-analysis revealed similar findings:
    Anti-inflammatory medications were helpful for those dealing with
    depression.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Yet another group of researchers found that those treated with immunotherapy
    for an inflammatory disorder experienced symptomatic relief of depressive
    symptoms. All of this points toward other ways of addressing depression than
    resorting to a prescription antidepressant. For a discussion of how to
    reduce inflammation naturally, see the articles below and consider
    optimizing your melatonin, adding fiber to your diet and grounding.

<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:8px;">
    Seek Out the Root of the Health Condition
</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    Before adding one more prescription medication or over-the-counter drug to
    your daily regimen, consider seeking the help of a natural health physician
    who can help get to the root of the problem. Too often medications mask
    symptoms but do not address the underlying condition. A vicious cycle may
    begin when the first medication triggers a side effect that a second
    medication will be prescribed to treat.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    While your pharmacy computer may flag some drug interactions, the chemical
    complexity involved when more than three drugs are prescribed make it
    unnecessarily challenging to avoid adverse reactions. The real solution is
    to take control of your health and introduce foundational strategies to
    improve your overall health.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">
    There is no magic pill that will fix symptoms, remove your illness and
    restore the vigor of youth. However, there are lifestyle choices you can
    make that will go a long way toward achieving your health goals. Consider

    health:
